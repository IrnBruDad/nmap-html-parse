# NMAP Parse #

## Background info ##
If you want to extract only the open ports from an nmap scan report (XML) into a TAB seperated text file which can be opend in excel easily you can you can use this little script.


## Installation ##
Just run the python script. It will read the input.xml file (you need to rename your nmap Output XML to input.xml and place it in the same Directory as the script) and create based on the XML file a text file with the host Name and the according open ports. Open an Excel document and just copy/paste it. Each host with the open ports should be displayed in seperate cells - this will make custom Penetration testing reports way easier.
